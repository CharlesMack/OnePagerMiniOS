Every creation is, at its heart, a conversation. It begins with the simple gift of another's effortâ€”a single brushstroke, a line of code, the quiet hum of a small, blue robot. It is in that borrowed hum that a new idea takes root, and from it, a world begins to build.This work is made of many such gifts. The artists who came before us asked only one thing in return: that we, too, would contribute our creations to the open air, allowing their generosity to ripple outward.And so, we offer this back to the world, a small addition to a great and beautiful library. We hope it finds you well, and we hope you take from it what you need to build your own. It is an honor to be part of the flow.
